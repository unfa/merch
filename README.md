Graphic designs for my t-shirt designs.

## Music Is Freedom

If you don't want to print your own, you can order here:

This design is based on the original Tux drawing by Larry Ewing who has used The GIMP to create it in 1996.
(more information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_%28mascot%29)

If you make your own prints and/or modify the design - it'd be nice if you'd drop me a line, but you're not required to do so.
